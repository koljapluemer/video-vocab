## Ideas

- allow practicing the vocab again
- improve the vocab gen: base forms, and give the translator context sentence
- repeat some vocab that's due within the practice
- think about when to repeat segments
    - and when to conjoin segments


- video overview page, where you can see progress
    - and where you can in sequence practice, or most urgent, or maybe all vocab
    - or click on specific segment

- revise video segment storing, maybe just w/ FSRS


- if segment not understood, set every card on it to 'due'


- allow marking important words in a segment
- allow per-segment notes (reflection, meta-cognition)
